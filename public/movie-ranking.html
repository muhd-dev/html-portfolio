        <hr/>
        <h3>Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters (2012)</h3>
        <p>This became my favorite since I strted photography and if you’ve had the chance to see 
            Gregory Crewdson’s works, you already know he is a legend of our time. His works are 
            powerful, captivating, and thought-provoking. This movie is about the photographer’s 
            creative process, and how he brings to life the mesmerizing images based off of his dreams. 
            This is a documentary-style film that has been shot over a decade and gives a 
            glimpse of the very talented and gifted creative individual.

        <h3>Free Guy</h3>
        <p> I really love this movie cause it is Sci-fi and I've always being fascinated by 
            Sci-fi movies since I was young. But this particular movie piqued my interest and 
            made me fall in love with coding and I honestly was not expecting this 
            film to be as creative, interesting and funny as it was. 
        </p>
        <h3>Flash</h3>
        <p> It was an absolute delight. Bursting with energy, heart, and a dazzling display 
            of superhero prowess, this film delivers a fantastic cinematic experience that 
            will leave you beaming with joy.

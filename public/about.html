  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello World! My name is Muhammad Idoniwako, and I am a Web Designer, Developer, 
  and Photographer.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in Lagos State, Nigeria, and later moved to Kaduna State, where I pursued my 
  passion for Photography. It was during this time that I realized my love for 
  capturing moments and decided to establish myself as a professional wedding and portrait 
  photographer. However, I soon recognized that my true purpose in life lies in inspiring 
  others and thriving in a dynamic and innovative environment where I can contribute to 
  its growth and continually evolve both professionally and personally.
</p>

<p>
  Driven by this realization, I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, eagerly acquiring 
  new skills such as copywriting, creative writing, graphic design, and public speaking. 
  I pride myself on being a versatile and multifaceted individual. <br />
  <br />
  As 2023 dawned upon me, 
  I pondered on expanding my horizons and delving into a new fieldâ€”one that would 
  complement my existing abilities. It was then that I wholeheartedly embraced the path of 
  a web designer and developer. The allure of utilizing this skill to solve significant 
  problems resonated deeply within me.
</p>

<p>
  With great determination, I made the decision to dedicate myself entirely to mastering 
  this craft. Moreover, an additional motivation for becoming a web developer stems from 
  my desire to create an app that simplifies the lives of my fellow creatives in managing 
  their businesses, organizing files, and communicating with clients. 
  I have personally experienced the stress of juggling multiple apps for these tasks, 
  and I am driven to alleviate this burden.
